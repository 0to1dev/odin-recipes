    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        <b>Lasagna</b> is a classic Italian dish featuring layers of pasta, rich meat sauce, creamy béchamel
        or ricotta cheese, and melted mozzarella. Each layer is carefully built to create a dish that is hearty,
        flavorful, and comforting. The meat sauce, usually made from ground beef or a mix of beef and pork, is simmered
        with tomatoes, garlic, onions, and Italian herbs to infuse a deep, savory flavor. Meanwhile, the cheese layers
        add creaminess that balances the tangy tomato sauce.
    </p>
    <p>
        Once assembled, the lasagna is baked in the oven until bubbly and golden on top. The pasta absorbs the flavors
        of the sauce and cheese, creating a tender, cohesive dish. Lasagna is perfect for family dinners or special
        occasions, as it is filling, satisfying, and can be made ahead of time for convenience.
