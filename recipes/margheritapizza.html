    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>Margherita Pizza</strong> is a classic Italian pizza known for its simplicity and fresh flavors. It
        features a thin, crisp crust topped with a vibrant tomato sauce, slices of fresh mozzarella cheese, and fresh
        basil leaves. A drizzle of olive oil adds richness, while baking in a hot oven gives the pizza a perfectly
        golden crust with slightly bubbling cheese.

        The beauty of Margherita Pizza lies in its balance — the acidity of the tomato sauce complements the creamy
        mozzarella, while the fresh basil adds an aromatic, refreshing note. This pizza is perfect for a quick weeknight
        meal or a special weekend treat and showcases the elegance of minimal, high-quality ingredients.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pizza dough (store-bought or homemade, enough for 1 medium pizza)</li>
        <li>1/2 cup tomato sauce</li>
        <li>6–8 oz fresh mozzarella cheese, sliced</li>
        <li>Fresh basil leaves, a handful</li>
        <li>1–2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>Salt, to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 475°F (245°C). If using a pizza stone, place it in the oven to heat.</li>
        <li>Roll out the pizza dough on a lightly floured surface to your desired thickness.</li>
        <li>Spread tomato sauce evenly over the dough, leaving a small border for the crust.</li>
        <li>Arrange slices of fresh mozzarella on top of the sauce.</li>
        <li>Add fresh basil leaves and drizzle lightly with olive oil. Sprinkle a pinch of salt if desired.</li>
        <li>Transfer the pizza to the oven (or onto a preheated pizza stone) and bake for 10–15 minutes, until the crust
            is golden and the cheese is melted and bubbly.</li>
        <li>Remove from the oven, let it cool for a couple of minutes, slice, and serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
