    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A <b>Bacon and Cheese Omelette</b> is a simple yet hearty breakfast dish that brings together the smoky flavour
        of bacon with the creamy richness of melted cheese. The recipe starts with cooking bacon until it's crisp,
        rendering out its fat, which also adds a deep savoury base. Meanwhile, eggs are beaten (with a bit of salt and
        pepper) and then poured into a hot pan—often using the bacon fat to cook them for extra flavour. As the eggs
        begin to set but still have a slightly runny top, shredded cheese is added so it melts into the warm eggs.</p>
    <p>Once the cheese is melting and the omelette’s underside has a golden-brown hue, the edges are gently loosened and
        the omelette is folded, enclosing the cheese and bacon inside. It’s then cooked for a little longer so the
        inside finishes nicely without becoming dry. When done, this omelette is warm, rich, and satisfying—cheesy,
        smoky, with the gentle texture contrast between crisp bacon bits and soft eggs. Perfect for a filling breakfast
        or even a simple dinner.</p>
